I’m Pranav, a self taught full stack developer. I've recently started to write about the things I know.

WHY did I start tho? cause I read an article about [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) and it really got me thinking, like huh? this could actually be fun So I made this website as a way of establishing myself as a part of this community.

A little about beginings, I actually gratuated as an electrical engineer but soon found out my passion for coding. At that time I did'nt actually know how to code but I found all these as pretty cool stuff and that's when I thought of actually giving this a shot.

If you would like to read this with some detail, I will soon write a blog about it!!
